### About me

My name is Maria and I am 20 years old. I come from a country that is not on the map. ***Transnistria***. I aspire to become a good web developer. Coding makes me feel good and relaxed. I like to learn new technologies and learn new implementations into old ones.
Quarantine helped me open the door to the __IT-world__, and now my friend, who got a job in an IT-company and works remotely, serves as my motivation. He did it - I can do it too!
